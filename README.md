#Tax Revenue Forecasting

This project aims to perform a tax revenue forecasting task using the data available till December 2005. The goal is to predict the tax revenue for the next 12 months from 2006 to 2007.

## Overview

Tax revenue forecasting is a critical task for governments and organizations to plan their budgets and allocate resources effectively. Accurate forecasting of tax revenue can help in avoiding financial shortfalls and reducing the risk of overspending.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation

Before performing the forecasting, it is necessary to clean and prepare the data. This includes handling missing values, converting data types, and removing any outliers that may affect the results.

## Model Selection

The next step is to select the appropriate forecasting model. There are several methods for forecasting time series data, such as ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, and Deep Learning models. The best method will be selected based on the accuracy of the forecasts and the ability to handle the characteristics of the data.

## Model Training and Evaluation

The selected model will then be trained on the data available till December 2005. The model will be evaluated using appropriate metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## Results

The results of the forecasting will be summarized in a report that includes the prediction of tax revenue for the next 12 months, along with a detailed analysis of the performance of the model.

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive tax revenue forecasting solution using advanced statistical methods and machine learning techniques. The results of this project can be used by governments and organizations to plan their budgets and allocate resources effectively.
